                        <p class="calibri main-text">Hello! My name is Chris Snyder and I have been working full-time as a Full Stack Developer for Triad Learning Systems since November 2017, and also have been doing freelance web development since 2013, but am always interested in hearing about other opportunities where my expertise could be utilized.  I graduated from Washington State University magna cum laude with a BBA in Management Information Systems.  Prior to that, I completed three degrees (all with honors) at Spokane Community College including an AAS in Software Development, an AA in Business, and an AA in Arts.  I have an excellent aptitude for learning new technical skills and a proven track record of becoming proficient in a short amount of time.</p>

                        <p class="calibri main-text">I enjoy spending quality time with family and friends.  I greatly enjoy humor and making others laugh and smile.  For fun I like to hike, bike, listen to music, collect vinyl records, play guitar, sing, and write songs.  I also enjoy doing home improvement projects, and working outside where I tend to an impressive vegetable garden.  I am a basketball fan and my favorite NBA team is the Portland Trail Blazers.  Even though I attended WSU (Go Cougs!), I am a huge fan of Gonzagaâ€™s basketball team.  When I am not busy with work, family, friends, or enjoying the other hobbies & interests mentioned, I spend a great deal of time expanding & refining my technical skills by learning as much as I can about software, web development, and dev-ops.  I decided to get into the software &amp; web development field because I genuinely enjoy and have a passion for it.</p>
